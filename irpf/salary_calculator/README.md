## Description

I'm creating this both for learning ruby && further understanding of how to calculate my salary after taxes.

So basically we have `BPS` & `IRPF`

### BPS
	- `FRL`: This is the 'Fondo de Reconversión Laboral', used for giving an opportunity to improve workers skills, specially for those who don't have a job atm. This is given through the "Instituto Nacional de EMpleo y Formación Laboral" or better known as INEFOP.
		Fixed amt: 0.125% from nominal salary.
>
	- `FONASA`: in summary, is the medical coverage for the worker and their family.

		| 3%       | Salary does not exceed 2.5 BPS ($14,150)                        |
