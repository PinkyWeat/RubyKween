## Interesting data

#### When running .rb files

- `ruby` `filename.rb`

This is the standard interpreter for running Ruby scripts. When doing as above, we are asking the Ruby interpreter to execute the file as a script.

- `irb` `filename.rb`

`irb` stands for Interactive Ruby. It's a `REPL` (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Ruby, allowing you to execute Ruby commands line by line interactively.
When using `irb`, we'll not only see the output of the program, but also the return value of the last expression in the file (which might not always be the actual "output" expected).
